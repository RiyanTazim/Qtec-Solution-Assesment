Run project. You will redirect to sign up page directly after running the project using php artisan server. Migrate the project. I also added my exported sql file. You can use it as well or you can sign up by yourself after migration.
Sign up will redirect you to log in page. Add note/notes from sidebar add note menu. You can add notes after login and also view list as per user authentication. No user can view other user's note list.
